Ever since I can remember computers have fascinated me. With an Associates of The Arts in Sociology doing basically nothing for be this took the inevitable turn to computer repair and then Information technology. Programing had always interested me as well, but the advanced math and large commitment of time and money always turned me off of my original goal of a computer science degree. Thatâ€™s when two of my friends went to App Academy in San-Francisco. Spurred on by their success and my reacquired interest in coding in large part due to my work in I.T. automation, I decided to make the leap. I did some self-study of ruby my interest quickly increased. Looking at a number of programing boot camps flatiron school stood out because of its quality and flexibility in schedule. So here I am, having a blast and looking forward to the possibility.
