Making the switch to JS was a bit of a shock. I had a hard time going back to basics and relearn stuff I felt I already knew in a new language. DevTips on Youtube has a video series on the DOM that was a real life saver. It put a lot of the JS stuff I had been learning back into context and helped me focus more effectively. I linked to the video for anyone who wants to check it out.
