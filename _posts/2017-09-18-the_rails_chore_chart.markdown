I might have taken on a little more than I expected when I started this one. My rails chore chart handles a few user to user interactions and that wound up being a lot harder than I thought It was going to be. Although I wonder if there isn’t a better way to handle it (some function in active record I don’t know about) it was a lot of fun and really satisfying figuring it out. Anyways basically the app allows a group of people to make a chore chart and mark things of as they are completed. Users have friends and teams and can accept tasks from the team’s chore list. All in all defiantly the most complicated app I have tried to construct in rails so far.
