Databases provide us with an immense amount of power and control in our applications. In preparing to start looking for work in the field of web development, I have been doing some research into the job market and best approach to finding work. I found a article that suggested that data structure was a weak point in most bootcamp programs. The author of this article suggested touching up on that area a bit and also pointed the readers to a interview class. Iâ€™m not sure I would spend the money on it but there are some free questions I wanted to share with everyone. Good luck and never stop learning.
