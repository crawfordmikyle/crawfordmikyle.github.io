This project was a challenge. I think in part because Iâ€™m much more confident in rails and it required me to break something I had working in rails and rebuild it in js. At the same time, I left this project feeling like I had learned a lot and feel more confident in my Javascript skills. All in all the most challenging part was trying to get dynamically created objects to have event listeners. Stack Overflow once again proved an amazing resource in both troubleshooting and solving that problem. I have included a link to that article for anyone who needs it.
