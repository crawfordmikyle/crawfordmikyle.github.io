This is the blog post for my sinatra app. This project was exciting because it was the first project I did that really turned out looking like a web app. I wanted my todo app to have an easy account set up but not let the same email be used twice just like any other web app I also wanted to play with bootstrap that I saw in the fwitter project. A lot of the code was the same. Validate the user and restrict viewing and editing of the tasks to the user who created it. I also started playing with handling invalid input and error messages more. All in all it was a fun project and I definitely feel accomplished.
