My first idea for this project was a portfolio page with some content management elements. Due to time constraints and the complexity of token-based authentication, I opted for a simpler message board application for this project. As it turns out this was a good thing. The smaller domain and this allowed me to focus understanding more about what redux and react was doing “under the hood”. I still want to build my portfolio page and now I can take on that project with the freedom to spend the time I need to learn token-based authentication. 

In conclusion, It really is amazing seeing everything coming together to create a modern dynamic web application. I am really excited to get into the industry, contribute to production applications and expand my knowledge of programming, JavaScript, and Ruby as well as all the tools and libraries that accompany those languages.
