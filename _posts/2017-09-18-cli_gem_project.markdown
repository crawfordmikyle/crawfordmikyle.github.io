After spending the better part of three days working on a gem that scraped baseball rankings from the mlb website I realized that I was supposed to have been recording some of my work. Struggling with coming up with another idea i decided to make a movie scraper and scrape movies and showtimes from fandango. After a quick planning phase (I admit I wish I spent more time on) I started. I had never made a gem before let alone with bundler from scratch. I watched some of the videos on that part of it and set off. It was not easy but each challenge really served to better my understanding of ruby. I came out of it much more confident in my understanding of hash iterations and the use of require to associate different files. If I were to do it again I probably would have spent some time developing a spec file. I wasted some time building something out only to scrap it and do it again because my plan for the program changed or I wanted to handle information differently.
