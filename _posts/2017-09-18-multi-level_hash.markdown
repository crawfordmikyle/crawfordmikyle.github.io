Back when I was thinking about getting a degree in computer science multilevel arrays were the absolute worst to wrap my head around. Now that I am older and wiser I grasp them with relative ease. 

That said if this week has been any indicator accessing/manipulating the data in them(or hashes as it were) still proves to be a challenge.

I think representing the array or hash visually and then sort of solving each layer on its own before putting it all together has probably been the most helpful way of getting around the more complex problems.

I worry a little about not grasping it as well as I may like at this point but then I remind myself that i'm still just starting and will have plenty of time to hone my art.
