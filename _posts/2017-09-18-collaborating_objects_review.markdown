# (The Best Video Ever)

Ok so I was worried about my understanding of **Object Oriented** ruby. I mean everything made sense (more or less) but I found myself struggling on the labs and referring back to reference material and past work a lot more than I normally do. The problems always turned out to be little things but still, I don't like it when I have to look up the answers it makes me feel like I haven't been **learning enough** and or **I'm missing something**. Anyways I get to the *Collaborating Objects Review* section and watch the video and it was then halfway through the video that the way these objects and their variables work together really made since. If you want an exact moment I think it was when the presenter showed the objects getting stuck in an infinite loop of adding themselves to each other and how to solve it. I went into the next lab and nailed it. I think this might be the most accomplished I have felt in this course so far. I had been struggling a big with a concept and it had just clicked in a big way. Not just how the objects collaborate but how an object can access the variables in another object
